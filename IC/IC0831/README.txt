Finish the exercises listed in the comments at the top of bottle_problem.py, roomba_problem.py, and graph_search.py.  Upload your versions of those three files after they are completed.  You can check (some) of the exercises with bottle_problem_tests.py and roomba_problem_tests.py.

Update Aug 31 6:40pm eastern: You do not need to do exercise 3 in roomba_problem.py, or the exercise in graph_search.py.
